// Secret ingredient reveal
===Chef_Learn_SECRET_INGREDIENTS===
In a sudden change of demeanor, the Chef leans back in his chair and stares into my eyes. "Alright." He begins. "The truth is I like to put secret ingredients into the meals. The Headmaster and Headmistress don't approve, but they don't know how much they like it! I've been doing it for months now, and have never had an issue like this!" In a harumph, the Chef turns in his seat. "Please now, that's all I know!" He whimpers. It appears he is telling the truth, but you cannot make it out for certain. 
    You turn back to the lineup.

// Double hand washing reveal
===Chef_Learn_FILTHY_KITCHEN===
In a sudden change of demeanor, the Chef leans back in his chair and stares into my eyes. "Alright." He begins. "The truth is my son, Beauregard." He gestures to the curled haired individual. "Is quite the unclean fellow. In an effort to bar the spread of disease in my kitchen, I implemented new cleaning standards for everyone! No hand will be left unwashed in MY kitchen!" He proudly announces, causing some of the other individuals in the kitchen to roll their eyes. "But I certainly don't know how that would relate to the death of the Headmaster!" He announced, and it seemed to me that I wasn't going to get any other good information out of him.

// Beauregard put gunpowder in the food reveal 
===Chef_Learn_BEAU_INGREDIENTS===
In a sudden change of demeanor, the Chef leans back in his chair and stares into my eyes. "Alright." He begins. "The truth is, for this occasion, due to how busy my responsibilities make me, I allowed my son Beauregard to include our secret ingredient. Clumsy as he is, I imagine he grabbed the wrong item! But I can't imagine something so horrid being stored in my kitchen! I promise, I've nothing peculiar here!" He claimed, and it seemed that's all he would say.

// Frog reveal and contraband
===Chef_learn_FRANK_EXPAT===
In a sudden change of demeanor, the Chef leans back in his chair and stares into my eyes. "Alright." He begins. "The truth is..." He darted his eyes left and right, moving his head and shoulders slightly to gesture to the small bullfrog sitting neatly on his chair. "Frank..." He spat. "He has some hidden contraband tucked away into the kitchen. If I had to guess, he had something to do with this! Don't look at me like that! He threatened me! I had no choice but to let him store his things here." He whimpered, turning to look at the Frog with contempt. After that, the Chef sat in silence, in a sullen anger.

// Gunpowder poprocks reveal
===Chef_Learn_POPROCKS===
In a sudden change of demeanor, the Chef leans back in his chair and stares into my eyes. "Alright." He begins. "The truth is, I think Ralph was the taste-tester for the Headmaster. Unofficially, of course. They were very friendly. If anyone were to know more about what the Headmaster ate, it would be Ralph! I recall that he mentioned a tingling sensation upon his taste test, but his head hasn't exploded!" He weeped. It appears that the Chef is no longer able to conduct the interview.

// Headmaster died because of gunpowder
===Chef_Learn_FULL===
In a sudden change of demeanor, the Chef leans back in his chair and stares into my eyes. "Alright." He begins. "The truth is, I think the Headmaster ate a gunpowder-filled caviar!" He exclaimed. "That must be it! Think about it: Ralph tasted a popping sensation in his mouth and Beauregard was in charge of the secret ingredient! It certainly wasn't me!" He pleaded. "I imagine it was some crazed chemical reaction that popped the Headmaster's skull! Stranger things have happened you know!" He finished, leaning back in his seat. "It can't be me!" He stated one last time, and I believed him.

// Conclude it all
===Chef_State_CONCLUSION===
In a sudden change of demeanor, the Chef leans back in his chair and stares into my eyes. "Alright." He begins. "The truth is, I think the Headmaster ate a gunpowder-filled caviar!" He exclaimed. "That must be it! Think about it: Ralph tasted a popping sensation in his mouth and Beauregard was in charge of the secret ingredient! With Frank leaving his contraband around-" I cut him off. 
"I imagine Beauregard, clumsy as he is, must have accidentally grabbed gunpowder and put it in the caviar! Frank's gunpowder, specifically! The Headmaster must have had some strange chemical reaction, causing his head to burst the moment I walked in." I continued, stroking my chin. "Alright, William. You're off the hook this time."

"Now, I need you to answer some questions." I harshly spoke, the lights around us dimming as the room morphed from a kitchen into my domain of choice: the classic interview room. The Chef hardly noticed as our surroundings changed. I smirked.
