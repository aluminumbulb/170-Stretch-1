"Mon Ami!" He cried. "What is going on in my restaurant?! To think the headmaster would die, under my watchful eye!" Screamed the chef, oh the wailing!

    -> slapChef
* [Calm the Chef down.]
    -> calmChef

"Now, I need you to answer some questions." I harshly spoke, the lights around us dimming as the room morphed from a kitchen into my domain of choice: the classic interview room. The Chef hardly noticed as our surroundings changed. I smirked.

== Questions ==

* "What is your name?"
    "Why, I am William Smith! A man with a true French accent!" He said, smiling proudly at himself. -> Questions
* "What did the Headmaster eat?"
    "All we did was serve him some caviar! I swears it!" He whimpered, losing his accent. -> Questions
* "What is the situation in the kitchen?"
    "There is no situation in my kitchen! I am a man of prestige good sir! The man simply must have had some sort of accident." He spoke unconvincingly. -> Questions
* "Tell me about... the frog."
    Darting his eyes back and forth. "W-what? There's nothing to tell. That's enough of that."
    * * "I certainly think not! Tell me everything you know about the frog."
        "Hey came to us! Many a night ago!" The chef began, rising slightyly from his chair, "We needed all the hands we could get, and I do not discriminate! Frank has shown that he is an adamant worker. A bit strange, but adamant! And that's all I could ask for." The chef nodded confidently, sitting back in his chair.

    "Alright that's enough." I commanded. "Tell me what your part in it all is!" I yelled, hoping to intimidate the Chef into loosing his tongue.
