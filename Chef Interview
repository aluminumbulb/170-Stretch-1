~ntchef = false //Set trigger for having talked to chef
"Mon Ami!" He cried. "What is going on in my restaurant?! To think the headmaster would die, under my watchful eye!" Screamed the chef, oh the wailing!

* [Slap some sense into the Chef.]
    -> slapChef
* [Calm the Chef down.]
    -> calmChef

"Now, I need you to answer some questions." I harshly spoke, the lights around us dimming as the room morphed from a kitchen into my domain of choice: the classic interview room. The Chef hardly noticed as our surroundings changed. I smirked.

== Questions ==

* "What is your name?"
    "Why, I am William Smith! A man with a true French accent!" He said, smiling proudly at himself. -> Questions
* "What did the Headmaster eat?"
    "All we did was serve him some caviar! I swears it!" He whimpered, losing his accent. -> Questions
* "What is the situation in the kitchen?"
    "There is no situation in my kitchen! I am a man of prestige good sir! The man simply must have had some sort of accident." He spoke unconvincingly. -> Questions
* "Tell me about... the frog."
    Darting his eyes back and forth. "W-what? There's nothing to tell. That's enough of that." -> Questions
* ->
    "Alright that's enough." I commanded. "Tell me what your part in it all is!" I yelled, hoping to intimidate the Chef into loosing his tongue.
    //This should probably be where you link up to the main reveal
     "Alright! Alright!" The Chef admitted. "I know that the Headmistress was planning something quite evil! You should talk to her about her recent plans."
