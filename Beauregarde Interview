    "Beauregard Smith. I'm err... a member of the staff here. I was recently promoted from janitor, thanks to the good graces of the head chef."

"Fath-err, the head chef is unlike any other, his recipies are a well-kept secret. I myself am in charge of the care and organizaiton of the finest ingredients in here! Of course.. where did I put that basket of..." he trails off, clearly realizing he would have revealed the chef's secrets.
"Nevermind. I'm in charge of restocking the shelves and that includes the chef's secret ingredients. It's just part of the way things are done here."

===Beau_Learn_FILTHY_KITCHEN===
"I'm still in charge of keeping this place clean, I've got a list of messes to deal with, and one's I've already dealt with, like that one tile right there!" 
He points to a tile that does not appear to be cleaned, and continues looking down a list that he wasn't holding a moment ago. 
"I keep the kitchen organized and clean! If you'll excuse me, I've got to go wash Frank's hands right about now."

===Beau_Learn_BEAU_INGREDIENTS===
"I was in charge of the final plating for the food tonight! I remember it clearly because the recipe called for caviar, and I had just moved that into place earlier today. It was a very quick trip into the pantry and back for the caviar." He gasps, covering his mouth.
"Err. Just don't tell anyone I told you what it was.

"That frog.. he's brought some odd ingredients into the kitchen before, muttering something about his past? I didn't think much of them, it's not like I have any place to tell him how to cook the food."

===Beau_Learn_POPROCKS===
"I was cleaning the kitchen door window at the time, and I think I saw that man.. Ralph? I think I saw him taste some of the food earlier...I didn't think anything of it at the time but he made a face, like he had something sour or zingy to eat... he could probably tell you more than I could." He laughs awkwardly, trailiing off.

===Beau_Learn_FULL===
The young man looks sick to his stomach, practically as green as the frog.
"I suppose the caviar must have gone bad? It smelled almost like rotten eggs..."
He wipes his hand with his face, looking nervous.
"It also didn't have the usual texture of the caviar now that I think about it..."
