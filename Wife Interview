// Secret ingredient reveal
===Wife_Learn_SECRET_INGREDIENTS===
"I love creative people, just like how I fell in love with my husband, a true artist with a lot of wealth, properties......"She halted a bit before she would spilt out more inappropriate words, "well that is why I hired our head chef William, he is absolutely a genius in cooking--he has his own secret recipe as if he is putting magic in the dishes. He must be thinking that I have no clue what he has done to the plates, but Imma tell you, I saw him pouring some unexpected ingredients quite a few times, it must have been the secret why the restructured meat tasted like angus beef..." Her tongue flicked across her lips as she finished.

// Double hand washing reveal
===Wife_Learn_FILTHY_KITCHEN===
"I own...my husband and I own the restaurant, we are out here to make money, why are we responsible for cleaning up the kitchen and stuff? They should clean up the working place if they can't live with that! Not my business!" She yelled fiercely as if she has nothing to do with the filthy kitchen. "And look at how they deal with that, all the staffs are forced to wash their hands! Good sign but why in the world my hands should also be washed? Everytime I came I was forced to wash away my perfume on my fine hands...blah blah blah..." Ignoring her complain, I started to skim through the kitchen that is nastier than the worst one in the 'Hell Kitchen' episodes, and soon my eyes stopped at a door that was left ajar: that's a bright and neat room behind, a few abstract paintings that seem worth thousands of bucks are hanging on the wall where underneath is a lether coach. Catherine followed my line of sight and realized that I was looking at the room, she dashed and slammed the door as if there are something unrevealable. "Th...that's my...and my husband's room. I swear I didn't spend a lot on the decoration."

===Wife_State_CONCLUSION===
In a sudden change of demeanor, the Chef leans back in his chair and stares into my eyes. "Alright." He begins. "The truth is, I think the Headmaster ate a gunpowder-filled caviar!" He exclaimed. "That must be it! Think about it: Ralph tasted a popping sensation in his mouth and Beauregard was in charge of the secret ingredient! With Frank leaving his contraband around-" I cut him off. 
"I imagine Beauregard, clumsy as he is, must have accidentally grabbed gunpowder and put it in the caviar! Frank's gunpowder, specifically! The Headmaster must have had some strange chemical reaction, causing his head to burst the moment I walked in." I continued, stroking my chin. "Alright, William. You're off the hook this time."

The woman in a red polka dot frock is sobbing in front of the line.

"So ma'am may I please ask you a few questions?" I asked gently, though trying hard to not have eye contact with her, just as hard as to not peep at the wobbling half-piece onion in the basket behinds where she is standing.
She looked up to me, hesitated for a second and said "okay keep it short."

* "Who are you?"
    "Catherine White! I am the only woman in the restaurant, who do you think I am?" She picked up her innocent face and turned to you quite impatiently.

* "What is the situation in the kitchen?"
    "There is no situation in my kitchen! I am a man of prestige good sir! The man simply must have had some sort of accident." He spoke unconvincingly.

* "Do you know about the frog?"
    "What the frog?" She shouted inconceivably, "I don't know anything about a frog, you animal!"
    -> QuestionsForWife
* "Who is that weirdo?"
    "You mean Ralph? Well he is a good friend of my husband, he usually hanging around in the kitchen, touching this and that." She shaked her head and continued,"god knows how much I hate his wiseacre attitude everytime he came in."

    "Alright that's enough." I commanded. "Tell me what your part in it all is!" I yelled, hoping to intimidate the Chef into loosing his tongue.
