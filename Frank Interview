===Frank_introduction===
Now this is something I never expected to see. A frog, about the size of a toddler, just working in the kitchen and minding their own damn business. My gut instinct tells me to tear this place apart, else I go to sleep tonight knowing a fucking frog is cooking in the kitchen of an Aristocrat. I could hear disco music coming from a cheap speaker somewhere in the kitchen, eventually transitioning into a four-on-the-floor house beat. This frog really enjoys their house music, anything to drown out the chaos occurring outside. I stil had to ask them what their place is here, in a kitchen fit for a king.

===Frank===
I make my way closer to the frog as they light a cigarette on a gas stove.
* "What the [hell are you doing here?"] hell are you doing here?" I inquisit.
    "Trying to save my own skin, considering the circumstances here" the frog snarkily replies "And you?"
    * * "I'd like to ask you a couple of questions my froggy friend"
        "Please, call me Frank" ->Questions_Frank
===Questions_Frank===

* "Do you know anything about what happened in the dining room?"
    "I heard a little pop outside, some commotion, and our melodramatic chef sobbing as if he owes that man anything more than the bare minimum." Frank said with an intoxicating sarcasm that pierced his relatively thick french accent. ->Questions_Frank
* "What's that Machine Gun doing mounted on the wall?"
    Frank makes the decision to exercise his right to remain silent, even though he wasn't under arrest.
    Silence deafens the room as the house album playing transitions to the next track. Scanning the room you begin to see more and more tools of destruction hidden in plain sight, marked only by a skull and crossbones. 
    ** "Give me one reason why I shouldn't suspect you killed The Headmaster"
        "What would I seek to gain from killing my employer? I may be a Socialist but twenty dollars is twenty dollars." Frank Says. ->Questions_Frank
* "What is the Chef around here like?"
    "Calling him a chef would be an insult to cooking. He's an imbecile in a chef's costume, a mere approximation" Frank says.->Questions_Frank

===Frank_SECRET_INGREDIENTS===
"Well, thank you for your time, now if you'll excuse me I have to get back to interviewing the other suspects, hopefully they will be more cooperative."
"Wait! Before you go. " Frank takes an unusual tone before quickly correcting himself. "The chef has this obsession with including 'secret ingredients' in all of his foods." Frank says spitefully. "I don't understand, why would you try to keep an ingredient secret if you weren't trying to hide something poisonous. He thinks he is the 'Kentucky Fried Chicken' man, coming up with these spice blends that completely boggle the mind!" Frank sounds as if he is genuinely confused at the methodology of Chef William. He also sounds like he has more information regarding the method of poisoning the Headmaster.
* "Do you think that the Chef poisoned the Headmaster?"
    "If he did, he sure didn't do it intentionally"
    ** "Thank you for your input Frank"

===Frank_BEAU_INGREDIENTS===
"One more thing before I leave, how do you feel about Beaurigard?" I ask Frank, hoping to crack the nut that is this kitchen right down the middle.
"I feel bad for him, he shows much potential but is forced upon too many stressful situations. He is the most exploited of us all." Frank says. "I would suspect him if he wasn't so stressed out from daily kitchen duties that poor boy."
* "Interesting, thank you very much"

"My pleasure, but I must apologise for being too harsh on you, as I am quite paranoid. You see, I am on the run from a foreign power that I will not continue to elaborate upon." Frank says.
* "Thank you for telling me this Frank."
What the fuck have I gotten myself into?

Before you even had the chance to leave, you hear Frank scream "HOLY SHIT"
* "What is it?"
    "My gunpowder must have made it into the caviar!"
    ** "At this point I'm not surprised" one bit.
