~ ntralph = false
You turn to the customer, who appears to be trying to blend in with the crowd. He is leaning on the wall and slightly hunched over, twiddling his thumbs in an almost, but not quite menacing fashion. He pretends to not notice you approaching until you snap him to attention. "OY! You there! What is a customer even doing in this corner of the establishment!?"

No longer fooling anyone, the customer suddenly adopts a bit of a mischievous grin. "Why, I'm no ordinary customer, fella. Haven't you heard about me, the magnificent connoisseur Ratty Ralph? Documenter of all known flavor combinations, the Guinness World Record holder for strongest sense of smell, the final say on ANY restaurant's reputation in the land-"
* [I recognize him.]
    ->recognized
* [I have no idea who the hell he is.]
    ->noideawho
    
===recognized===
You are amused by his claims. "Yeah yeah I've heard about you, though I definitely don't think you're in the world records, nor have I heard of any restaurant that took your advice seriously."

"...Well, yeah, that's kind of true," he says apologetically, "but I gotta act strong in the face of adversity, fella. And besides, the part about documenting flavor combos IS true. Hehe."
->enough

===noideawho===
You have no idea what he's going on about. "Look here, I don't know who you are or what makes you so special, but someone appears to have just spontaneously combusted over there, and no amount of status is going to save you from being interrogated."

He lowers his head in disappointment, but not shame. "Alright then, fella. Go on with your 'interrogation.' Even though you're not really a detective."
->enough

===enough===
You decide you just want to get this over with, perusing your head for questions that this mess of a person could possibly comprehend.

"So what are you really doing in the kitchen? Be honest, for goodness sake."

"Oh, well...I got a bit of a strategy to writing my riveting food reviews, you see, fella. Don't tell anyone...but...I like hanging out in the kitchen for the food, if you catch my meaning."
*["So you taste the food?"]
"So you...taste the food...before it's even served?"

"Exactly! That way I can really get a feel for what ingredients are in every dish, how it all tastes, without, you know...spending the cash to order it all."

As a health inspector, this revelation leaves you highly disconcerted. "So that's why they call you Ratty Ralph! You're a damn fiend! Snooping around the kitchen where no one wants you, potentially contaminating everything you touch..."
->inkitchen2

===inkitchen2===
*["Does the chef know?"]
"Does the chef know about this...OUTRAGEOUS offense??"

"Oh, of course he does, fella. He's cool with it. Him and that kid Beauregard, they just let me do my thing and no one bats an eye. And hey, what harm has it done? Not like anyone has died from the food here or anything...uhm, until today."

You can't believe this idiot. With that amount of unprofessional access to the food, he could have snuck anything in. But you decide to put it off for now.
->inkitchen3

===inkitchen3===
*["Anything else unusual?"]
"Well, can you think of anything...unusual that you've seen while you've been back here?"

"Mmm...the crab they use smells a bit funky, and the wine is super cheap."

You sigh. "Well, that doesn't tell me much. Let's move on."

===restaurant===
You're not entirely sure if the question you ask is relevant to the investigation, but as a health inspector, you have to get an opinion. "So, have you found the restaurant to be on par with others you have reviewed?"

At this, Ralph becomes jubilant. "I've been coming here every day for months! There's something special about the textures and flavors of the meals here. Zesty, tender pork, crunchy, fishy prawns, sweet and sour umami soup, frog legs, etc etc. They have it all, fella! However..."

*["Go on..."]
"What is it?" you implore.

"Well...I have to admit that the quality in both food and service has been down a peg or two recently. I once tasted ammonia in my pizza! Why, if I want ammonia in my pizza, I'll go to Seven Eleven, not this exquisite dining! And the Cordon Bleu was dry as a rock yesterday! Worst of all, when I asked the chef to remake it, he gave me a plate of ACTUAL rocks! How insulting!"

You find this mildly funny, and maybe a red flag for inspection, but not a direct explanation for the headmaster's explosive demise. "That sounds like quite a pickle," you tell him.

"Oh no, the pickles are very good in comparison."

Ralph strokes his chin for a bit, then shakes his head. "I can't think of anything else at the moment. Sorry, fella."
->INTERROGATE_RALPH

===headmaster===
"You know anything about the headmaster of this business?"

"I knew plenty about him, back in the day, fella," Ralph confided. "He is...uhm, was...a good ol' friend from school - we were in many of the same classes, you see. We used to run a pop-up cart where we'd sell all sorts of edible goodies like hunks of fresh buzzard, non-pretzel wheels, some literal snake oil, you know. We shared a bond over our love of real AND legitimate food!"

*["What about now?"]
"But what's your present relationship with him?" You ask, really just wanting to get to the point.

"Oh..." Ralph grumbles to himself a bit before going on. "Well, I don't know much about his recent antics. We dropped out of contact after school, and I only rediscovered him and his restaurant a few months back. We haven't gotten to talking all that much, fella. I've been too busy with my food reviews!"

There's a glint in his eyes when he speaks that unnerves you.

You begin looming over Ralph angrily, physically growing in size. Ralph cowers in fear, physically shrinking in size. You ask calmly, "WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE HEADMASTER, YOU BUMBLING BAFFOON!??!?!?!?!?!??!"

Ralph is taken aback. "I-I've told you all I know, f-fella, I swear it by my beard!"

You both abruptly return to normal physical size. "Okay, that's all I've got," you say, "You win. Let's forget about this line of discussion."

"Roger roger," says Ralph, rather flatly.
->INTERROGATE_RALPH

===headmistress===
"What about the headmistress? You know anything about her deal?"

"Hmmm, her..." Ralph adopts a hateful scowl. "Quite unlike her husband, she's despised me ever since I chose to spend half of my waking hours here. No fault of my own, I'm sure, fella! I only SOMETIMES pair saltines with the desserts I order, just because I like to try sweet and salty mixed together. And I only ONCE spat into her soup, completely accidentally.

"But alas! She took one look at me and from then on she's had this disgusted sneer on her face whenever she sees me, clear as day."

*["Does she seem suspicious?"]->headmistress2

===headmistress2===
"Does it seem like she has an ulterior motive to you? Perhaps related to her husband's death?"

Ralph does not hesitate. "Why, she's got layers and layers of secrets, I'm certain of it. But I wouldn't know any of them, not me, no, never. I'm not privy to any of it fella, like I said."

Sensing how much of a scoundrel Ralph is, you do not believe his lies. "Oh really now? I think you may very well be connected with it, you ratty fiend!"

Ralph protests vehemently. "Am not!"

As childish of a response as that is, you give up. "I suppose that's all I'm going to get from you."

"Well, I think that's everything, Ralph."

"Good riddance," Ralph mutters under his breath.

Satisfied that you've wrangled all the information out of this charlatan as you possibly could, you head back towards the rest of the suspects.

===Ralph_Learn_SECRET_INGREDIENTS===
Ralph strokes his chin for a bit, then his eyes light up and he makes a dramatic hand motion. "Oh, yeah! There was this time I ordered a cocktail that was very strong, fruity and delicious, but smelled absolutely rotten and revolting. I was intrigued by this dichotomy, so the next day while in the kitchen I tried to figure out what had been put in there to make it so weird."

He pauses conveniently to take a deep breath before moving on. "And fella, guess what I found! The chef had put up a list of so-called 'secret ingredients' that he cycles through every week. Guess what was on there the day before? Durian! No wonder it smelled so bad and still tasted so good! The menu didn't so much as mention it!"

You think this could be useful information. The chef must've been putting secret ingredients into the food without telling his customers about it.

"Thanks for the information, 'fella'," you say to Ralph. He nods aggressively in response.

===Ralph_Learn_FILTHY_KITCHEN===
Ralph strokes his chin for a bit, then his eyes light up and he makes a dramatic hand motion. "Oh, yeah! So every time I come in, the chef tells me that my hands need to be washed. Now, it's a bit rude for him to ask this of every customer who comes in - which he does - but it's especially rude for him to do this to me, the magnificent Ratty Ralph! Anyway, that's not the worst part."

He pauses conveniently to take a deep breath before moving on. "You wanna know what he does, fella? He takes every customer to the sink in the back, and not only does he force them to wash, he uses his OWN HANDS to wash theirs! Dreadfully uncouth of him, and quite the overcompensation for cleanliness, I might say! But I've gotten used to it over time, and ultimately, the food is worth it."

Quite the overcompensation indeed. You realize that through enforcing such strict cleanliness guidelines, the cooking environment must actually be incredibly filthy.

"Thanks for the information, 'fella'," you say to Ralph. He nods pensively in response.

===Ralph_Learn_BEAU_INGREDIENTS===
Ralph stops you. "Oh, hang on a second, fella...actually, I remember seeing a big jar of caviar just sitting on a table somewhere. I waited for a while to see if anyone would use it, but when they didn't...well, I borrowed it."

"You mean you stole it for yourself." You look at him crossly.

"It looked like everyone had forgotten it was there. I figured the chef wouldn't mind."

You realize that this caviar was definitely the secret ingredient the chef was planning to use for the headmaster's dish. But if it wasn't there when Beauregard cooked it...he must have grabbed something else to use as the secret ingredient! Something by random!

"Thanks for the information, 'fella'," you say to Ralph. He nods dismissively in response.

===Ralph_Learn_FRANK_EXPAT===
Ralph stops you. "Oh, hang on a second, fella...actually, I remember finding this strange compartment in the back of the kitchen. I would've opened it, but it had a lock to it. I smelled something very odd in there, something that didn't smell like it belonged in a kitchen...

"What did it smell like?" You look at him inquiringly.

"It was rather sulfurous and stale. Kind of like gunpowder. I saw that blasted frog sitting by it once."

You are shocked beyond belief. Why was there gunpowder in the kitchen? The frog must've been storing it there!

"Thanks for the information, 'fella'," you say to Ralph. He grins proudly in response.

===Ralph_Learn_POPROCKS===
You hear Ralph making a commotion behind you and turn back around.

"I dOn'T fEeL sO gOoD, fElLa..," Ralph clutches his mouth, and he appears to be entering a bit of a panic. Exasperated, you walk back over. "What's the matter now!?" You hear a mild popping noise.

Ralph struggles to get the next words out. "i MuSt'Ve eaTen somEthIng BaD bacK tHere...mIghT've been frOm that PlaTe the Kid BeaUreGard wAs CooKing uP...."

You hear more popping. "Wait a second," you exclaim, "What's that sound?"

"iN my moUth...," Ralph whimpers, "It FeelS liKe tHe PopRocKs I Used to Eat aS a bOy, bUt so MucH wOrse..."

Poprocks? Could that have been the gunpowder you found? Could gunpowder, of all things, have been tossed into a dish by mistake? Beauregard must have done it, in place of the secret ingredient!

Ralph seems to have recovered a bit, and the popping has died down. "I think I'm oKay now, fella."

"If you've consumed anything dangerous like gunpowder, we should probably get you to a hopsital."

"Nah I'm good, Fella. Don't believe in that hOspital business. I'm a tOugh cooKie."

You know you should really protest more, but you're so unbelievably done with Ratty Ralph that you can't be bothered to help him anymore. You head back towards the rest of the suspects.

You hear Ralph making a commotion behind you and turn back around.

"I...m-mY mOuTh Is On FiRe, FeLlA....." Ralph groans, and you can see sparks flashing inside of his mouth, making pop-pop-pop noises. He clutches his mouth in an attempt to keep it in, but you can hear the pops getting louder and his face begins to puff up. Aghast, you stand back as Ralph emits a final, high-pitched, horrific scream and pops, exploding into many Ralph-parts all over the kitchen.

...

...

...

"Well, that just about explains it," you say after a long pause, aloud for some reason. "The poor headmaster must've been done in by those dastardly poprocks that Beauregard foolishly stuffed in his dish. Simply tragic. Well, you can join your friend in the afterlife now, 'fella'."

Sensing how much of a scoundrel Ralph is, you do not believe his lies. "Oh really now? I think you may very well be connected with it, you ratty fiend!"

Ralph protests vehemently. "Am not! I just know that Catherine has been awfully cold and distant about the death of her husband. Not that she isn't usually cold and distant anyways, but you might think she'd have a genuine looking reaction to such an event? No! I saw her just rubbing her eyes into a cut-open raw onion? Who does that!?"

Ralph is taken aback. "O-okay, okay! Chill it, f-fella! I'll tell you."

"All I know is that my friend has been real distant from his wife. Why, just about anyone could tell when they were walking in! They refused to look at each other, they barely spoke, Catherine just sat crossly doing her 'hmph' thing. They looked like they were having marital problems, it's quite possible that an affair took place. That's truly all I know! I swear it by my beard!"

You both abruptly return to normal physical size. "Okay, I believe you," you say, "even if my tommy gun don't."

Sensing how much of a scoundrel Ralph is, you do not believe his lies. "Oh really now? I think you may very well be connected with it, you ratty fiend!"

Ralph protests vehemently. "Am not! I just know that...well..." He takes approximately 15 seconds to clear his throat before going on. "I am aware of a conniving, malicious deed she might have been planning to execute. MURDER! Murder, I say, fella!"

You feel the very fabric of the universe emit an audible "GASP, FELLA!" before he continues again.

"How do I know of this, you may ask? Well, there was a time within the last week where I was in the kitchen late at night, later than usual. Catherine was the only other one there, and in the dark, I overheard her talking through a plan to stab her husband and snag his inheritance! She was even brandishing a knife in her hand! I ran straight out of there!"

Could the headmistress have killed her husband this very night? You ponder at the possibility. Then you realize something. "Why didn't you tell your friend about it!?"

"I did, I did! But he didn't believe me!"

You're not sure that last bit makes any sense or if it's at all true, but this revelation alone is enough for now.

Ralph is taken aback. "O-okay, okay! Chill it, f-fella! I'll tell you."

"You're right, I knew about the planned murder attempt. I overheard her talking through her plan in the kitchen when she thought no one was around, brandishing a knife in her hand. She already hates my guts, and when she saw me she threatened my life if I told anyone about it, fella! She practically chased me outta there!

"In truth, I didn't even tell my friend - I know, I know, I'm terrible, but I was terrified! Anyway, doesn't seem like it mattered in the end, cause he clearly didn't die from a stab wound. Unless she changed her plans, I doubt she got around to it in the end."

You both abruptly return to normal physical size. "Okay, okay...I believe you," you say, "even if my tommy gun don't."

Sensing how much of a scoundrel Ralph is, you do not believe his lies. You begin looming over him angrily, physically growing in size. He refuses to cower in fear, instead staring blankly at your towering figure. You say calmly, "OH REALLY NOW? I ALREADY KNOW THAT THE WIFE WANTED TO MURDER HIM, BUT DIDN'T. BUT PERHAPS YOU DID, YOU RATTY FIEND!?"

Ralph is barely disturbed by your intimidation tactics. He simply states, "I had no beef with my friend, fella. We were as close as could be, back in the day. And then we weren't. Life got in the way, that's it. I suspect the same thing happened to Catherine, fella - life simply got in the way, and she didn't have the time to do away with him before something else happened. There's something else going on, and I'd try my hand talking to the others around here instead of me. You're barking at the wrong fella, fella."

Having been soundly defeated, and having wasted all of your energy on this side plot, you abruptly shrink in size permanently.
