Alone with the invisible wait-staff, it became perfectly clear to me what this entity was. You see them from time to time in the Health Inpspection business, a Malotropa. 

These apparitions are not ghosts as they were never human, rather they are the result of the residual malcontentment of service workers. The screams of frustration in the walkins, the tears of a fevered breakdown, and a smoke from a break as-soon-as-you-can-get-is enough to make one. 

Good evening, Inspector. I'm pleased to answer any questions you may have. Take long enough and we may be able to get into payed overtime territory.

//NOTE: For Stern, I'm going to try to fit in the information into general questions.

Ask About:
    *[The Victim]
    Oh dear yes. The headmaster of the establishment, I'm afraid. Though I can't say I'm too terribly broken up about the ordeal. He's the only reason this miserable establishment hasn't fallen apart already.
    
    Perhaps with him gone, his wife can finally mismanage one hundred percent of his funds, instead of the usual ninety.
    
    But no. I'm afraid I had nothing to do with his sudden sessation. I simply delivered him the dish and returned to work.

    *[{ntchef: The Chef| William}]
    Ah, Chef Williams. A competant man capable of producing the swill that hogs continue eagerly feasting on. His son on the other hand is a mess. {StoryStates has head_explodes && s1_info: ->M_Learn_SECRET_INGREDIENTS}

    *[{ntbeau: The Red Haired Kid| Beaurigard}]
    You mean the Chef's son. The boy is two left sets of table cutlery I'm afraid. He has no business putting on his cloths in the morning, let alone being second in command to his nepotistic father. 
    
    Perhaps he has realized his son is hopeless, but he's been trying to acclamate the boy to authority. There's no sense prepping a dish you don't have the ingredients for if you ask me.

    A story as old as time, a sugar momma picks up a young buck. Her fortunes fall, while his bankrolled pet projects actually succeed. Imagine, free time directly resulting in an increase of capital.

        Mmm yes. Him. A friend of the Headmaster I believe. He comes in frequently to "inspect" the kitchen. Of course, all he does is snag bites of meals as they go out. 
        
        It may be of use to you to know that he, in fact, ""sampled"" the supposedly lethal dish himself.

    * [Yourself, monsieur]
        I have been the waiter here for as long as ownership has changed. I, of course, am a Malocopa of this building. I'm afraid I'm along for whatever ride may occur within these walls.
        
        I must say, this is the sorriest state I've ever been in. Why, back in the day this used to be a burlesque club! Why, with the willpower and number of employees back then, I was alive and full of energy, if not as clothed. 
        
        [They indicate their waiter's garb matching the restaurant's atmosphere]
        
        {StoryStates has ralph_pop_rocks && s1_info: ->M_Learn_FULL}
        
        I am sorry to say that at the time of delivering the meal, I was entirely unaware of its lethality. The Headmaster was bad for business, but it is time for these old souls to be laid to rest with the building. Had he lived a while longer, I am sure he would have successfully run us into the ground!

It was his idea to add "Secret Special Ingredients" the specials to add a bit of something or other to the dishes. In truth, he just grabs some spice or another from his spicerack and throws it in regardless of composition.

*[Like?]
*[Anything explosive?]

Oh don't worry, all above board. Nothing explosive to my knowledge.

The worst part about her involvment is that she feels as though she is making "smart decisions". "Smart" being a one part intellect, and nine parts thriftyness. Look at the state of the kitchen, filthy.

Rather than pay for pest control measures AND a night staff, she has instead tied sponges to the stomachs of rats caught such that they may clean while they scurry. I am frankly surprised someone has not died already. I would just close this place down now, if I were you.

Yes today, for instance, the boy was put in charge of selecting the secret ingredient for the meals today. Oh I know! The honor and responsibility involve makes me tremble as well. 

*[Could he have tampered with the food?]
*[Would he have any reason to kill the chef?]

I doubt greatly that the boy would make a capable assissin if that's what you're suggesting. One can imagine him dosing some string with poison and immediately picking his nose. No in fact I saw him put the spice on the meal in question. It seemed to be un-crushed pepper on caviar.  Disgusting it is, poison it is not.

I would like to show you something as a means of demonstration. 
[The empty suit apppears to pat itself down. Out of the breast pocket floats a bullet]
I am the kitchen in microcausm, so what is stored in there comes out in me in some ways
*And you're saying a bullet is on the menu?
*So do you have a miniature cordon bleu tucked away?
- No, not quite. Anything in my person is just a small trinket, of no real value besides representative.

As you can see, I have little bullets, buckets of gun powder, and not a few explosive devices infesting my garments. 

This is due to the toad. If you'll forgive the expression, he seems to be in a persitant state of "feeling froggy". He's hidden weapon caches all over the kitchen in case I don't know who comes for him.

To be honest, storing materials and componants for a one-frog-malitia is becoming troublesome. One can often find ingredients of death along with the ingredients of soup.

The man has the gall to wonder around the kitchen and behave like he is a professional taster while pilfering our stores. When he sampled the dish in question, he said "Like pop-rocks I used to eat as a boy. Crunchy, earthy, with a bit of fizzle.".

What on earth does that mean? Did the man eat street fireworks as a boy? One can only hope it was as a boy, but he didn't seem too displeased with the flavor.

===M_Learn_FULL===

Inspector, perhaps I am in a unique position as an embodiment of this kitchen and its staff, but some clues have come together for me. That is, the boy's inability to do anything correct and yet being tasked with delivering a "secret ingredient".

The fact that this ingredient's flavor matches none in my culinary experience. Finally the fact that we have become inadvertantly a partial arms manufacture. Well, would you like to know what I think, or shall I let you peice it together yourself?

*[I like trying to figure things out!]
    Very well, sir. Best of luck with your report, then. 
*[Getting some information wouldn't hurt]
    I believe what may have happened was this: The boy, mistaking cached gunpowder for unground pepper, placed it throughout the caviar. As our dear headmaster ate, the more powder built up in his mouth. At some point the concentration must have been so great that a spark from his teeth set off the explosion.

Actually, come to think of it, things have been tense between the two for some time now. I'm afraid the finer details are beyond me, but married for so long and with so little truly in common, it is rare for a couple to happy, or even stable.

I'm afraid I have no recourse but to tell you the following. I am privy in some ways to the expenses made using the funds of this place. Our freshly minted Miss Parsennon has spared no expence on a series of interesting purchases. Poisons, pistols, even the occational blade.

 I must make something clear. I know you have been hearing rumors about our freshly minted Miss Parsennon. I would like to make a detail clear. As I heard the pop, I noticed her put something back in her bag.
 
 By the looks of the thing, it was a small caliber revolver.

 No, I'm afraid this item does not appear capable of doing the deed. Firstly, such a caliber could hardly remove a head. Furthermore, its saftey seemed to be in the 'on' position.

Something that must be noted about Frank. He is a good chef, and in his own way a friendly individual. However he is not without pursuers. Not long after he first arrived, and the chef gave him a job, people came asking for him. 

Let me tell you, it is difficult to lie about having seen a chain-smoking, self-hating, french-frog. On that note, the men had accents to. They dressed in all black, even their barrets.

A good guess! No in fact our dear frog is a gentle soul. He was once a strong croak foor a populist socialist movement in France. When it failed, he was sent to an exclusion zone. There he did his utmost to develop a community. 

And what bolsters a community more than spirits? So he willingly violated french Wine Laws, and produced spirits for his commune. So as not to feed into the country that turned its back on him, he produced his champagne in Portugal. This of course, made him a target for the french Wine Purity Agency.

I assure you they are surprisingly strong, and brutal. 

Would they allow our headmaster to be killed? No I think not. No windows were shattered, and no men in black were present.
